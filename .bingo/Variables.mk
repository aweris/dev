# Auto generated binary variables helper managed by https://github.com/bwplotka/bingo v0.2.3. DO NOT EDIT.
# All tools are designed to be build inside $GOBIN.
GOPATH ?= $(shell go env GOPATH)
GOBIN  ?= $(firstword $(subst :, ,${GOPATH}))/bin
GO     ?= $(shell which go)

# Bellow generated variables ensure that every time a tool under each variable is invoked, the correct version
# will be used; reinstalling only if needed.
# For example for k3d variable:
#
# In your main Makefile (for non array binaries):
#
#include .bingo/Variables.mk # Assuming -dir was set to .bingo .
